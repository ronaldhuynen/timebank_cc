# MIGRATING CYCLOS DATABASE TO LARAVEL


# Anonymize email addresses for testing purposes

```sql
UPDATE members
SET email = CONCAT(id, '@test.nl');
```


# Collation:
If you want 'GÃ©raldine' and 'Geraldine' to be considered as unique, you should use a binary collation like `utf8mb4_bin` or a case-sensitive, accent-sensitive collation like `utf8mb4_cs_as`.
Oiginal cyclos database needs this distinction, but uses an older collation type: utf8mb3_general_ci
that does not support emoji's.

Recommended collation Laravel database:
utf8mb4_bin
This is already set in config/database.php


# Remove view from export before importing into laravel database:
sed '/^\/\*!50001 CREATE/,/^\/\*!50001 DELIMITER/d' /path/to/your_file.sql > /path/to/clean_file.sql
mysql -u username -p database_name < /path/to/clean_file.sql



## Cyclos members

1. System Administrators
5. Users
6. Inactive Users
8. Removed Users
13. Local Bank (Level I)
14. Projects
15. Project to create Hours (level II) 
17. Local Admin
18. TEST: Projects
22. TEST: Users
27. Inactive Projects    

---
Excluded from  migration:
System Administrators (cyclos group_id 1)
Local Admin (cyclos group_id 17)
(As no admin table is yet created. The super-admin is created during db:seed process.)

Cyclos member 3170 and 3633 have the same email ronald.huynen@timebank.cc this gives an migration error!


To migrate execute:
php artisan migrate:cyclos_users


## Cyclos member accounts
Cyclos account types:
1 = Debit account
2 = Community account
3 = Voucher account (not used)
4 = Organization account (not used)
5 = Work account users
6 = Gift account users
7 = Project account projects

In Cyclos, a User owning a Work Account, could change into a Project and then it would own a Project Account, and vice versa.
In the Cyclos db these both accounts remain to exist. However their member_status would change between A and I (active and inactive). The only difference between the account types is the owner permission group and the upper and lower credit limits. Therefore this historic data does not need to be migrated into Laravel. During the migration the current permission group (user or organization) decides the height of the Laravel account limits. Only currently active accounts are migrated: users get 2 accounts (work and a gift) and organizations a single (project) account.



# Account intergrety check:


This query checks for any from_account_id in the transfers table that does not have a matching cyclos_id in the accounts table.

SELECT t.from_account_id
FROM `timebank_2024_06_11`.`transfers` t
LEFT JOIN `timebank_cc_2`.`accounts` a ON t.from_account_id = a.cyclos_id
WHERE a.cyclos_id IS NULL
GROUP BY t.from_account_id;

Similarly, this query checks for any to_account_id in the transfers table that does not have a matching cyclos_id in the accounts table.

SELECT t.to_account_id
FROM `timebank_2024_06_11`.`transfers` t
LEFT JOIN `timebank_cc_2`.`accounts` a ON t.to_account_id = a.cyclos_id
WHERE a.cyclos_id IS NULL
GROUP BY t.to_account_id;
